# Web Dev Vocab Cheet Sheet

**GitHub** - a web based version control system that promotes collaboration. A lot of developers build locally before sending to production and Github is a good place to keep a copy of their code in case their computer crashes (much like Google Drive).

**Version control** - developers make a lot of changes and improvements to their code, much like editing an article! Version control helps keep track of the changes made over time.

**HTML** - Hypertext Markup Language. It is the building blocks of the web and helps create the structure of a page using tags. Used for placing text, images and other content on a website.

**HTML tags** - HTML instructions usually appearing in pairs. For instance a <p></p> renders in the browser as a paragraph.

**CSS** - Cascading Style Sheets. A style sheet language that allows to add color, align elements on the page and much more. It's responsible for the presentation of the HTML elements.

**Commit** - When you have worked on code locally on your machine and you push your code up to Github, you are committing your code to the version control system.

**Dev environment** - when you work on your code locally on your machine you are working within a development environment which is generally a mirror of the production environment.

**Prod environment** - this is the live production environment and is what you see when you visit any webpage on the internet. We only send code to the production once code has been reviewed and sent to QA.

**QA** - quality and assurance. This is the team responsible for testing all of the code you right to make sure it renders correctly on all devices.

**Standup** - the daily meeting where all developers get together for about 15 min. to discuss the tasks they will be working on for the day. Sometimes this involves product teams or even producers so that everyone is aware of what projects are currently being worked on.

**Web browser** - is a software application for retrieving, presenting and traversing information across the web

**The Internet** - is a collection of networks that are made up of physical cables.

**The Web** - is software that runs on the internet that is composed of webpages built out of HTML.

**HTML attribute** - Attributes or parameters for HTML tags that modify the tag’s behavior. Attributes are always placed in the opening HTML tag. For example, href is the attribute in the following anchor tag (used to create hyperlinks): <a href="http://www.google.com">Search engine</a>

**Sprint** - is a set period of time during which specific work has to be completed and made ready for review (usually about 2 weeks)

**Agile methedology** - Work is based on an incremental, iterative approach

**Waterfall methedology** - Projects have a discrete start and finish

**URL (Universal Resource Locator)** - the address of a World Wide Web page

**Code** - Code can be a combination of letters, numbers and symbols

**Stack** = the stack of software a dev team uses; the languages that the team uses

**Front-end Languages** - Languages that primary deal with what you see in the browser. They are responsible for displaying data, animations, colors, etc.

**Back-end Langauges** - Languages that are primarily responsible for extracting data from the database.

**Doctype Element** - The Document Type element. It is actually an instruction to the web browser about what version of HTML the page is written in.
