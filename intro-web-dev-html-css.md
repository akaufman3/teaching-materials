We use the internet every day for many tasks, but when entering into the world of engineering, it’s good to start to begin to understand how the internet works behind the scenes. Let’s take a minute to watch this video to understand how the internet is set up and what happens when you connect to the internet.

## What is the Command Line?

>“As author Neal Stephenson famously put it, “In the Beginning was the Command Line.”Although a graphical user interface (GUI) can dramatically simplify computer use, in many contexts the most powerful and flexible way to interact with a computer is through a command-line interface (CLI). In such an interface, the user types commands that tell the computer to perform desired tasks. These commands can then be combined in various ways to achieve a variety of outcomes.”
